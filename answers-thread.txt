there are keys missing because the put function breaks if it gets to an empty entry.
between lines 49 and 50, the entry might have created and the function adds a value to it.
thus we get a value assigned to an entry without the key.
the key is then not found.

I failed to understand why pthread_mutex_init is needed, it works without it just fine.
Maybe it's initializing automatically?
