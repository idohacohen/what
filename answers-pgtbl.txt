I suppose dup and link can be used this way as
they only change how the process itself calls files.

Page 0 contains the text or the code the process runs.
page 2 is the stack.
page 1 is the data, in user mode it can be read but not written to.

Im not sure whts the third to last page, maybe the kstack.
