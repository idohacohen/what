The call arguments are stored in the registers a0-a7,
In main, the register that holds 13 is a2.

f() was called before line 26 where the the program inserts 12 
into the register after it had computed f(8)
g() is copied into f() and is not really called.

printf() is located on line 64a on the code which is in line 1114 in the file.

The value of $ra after printf is called is its pc+4 which is 38

The output is HE110 World.
In order for the code to run on a big endian system we just need to flip the bytes in i.
0x00646c72 -> 0X726c6400.
the value of 57616 does not need to be changed as it is read as a hex
so it is stored and read the same way.

It print some random number that happened to be in the stack beforehand.
It does this because it expect more arguments then were given and just reads
the value that is where the extra argument was supposed to be.
