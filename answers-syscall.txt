the function that called syscall() is usertrap() frm the file kernel/trap.c

7

the spp byte is 0 so the previous mode was usertrap

lw	a3,0(zero) (i got a different sepc than in the instructions)
a3 is the register corresponding with num

the kernel crashed because it tried to load to a variable data from a location it doesn't have access to
the scause shown is 'd' which means 13 which means there was a problem with the load page.

the pid is 1
